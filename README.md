## Setup

Requirements:

* Latest [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (>=7.10.1) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) if you prefer) to run the api server and web gui
* [libimobiledevice](https://github.com/libimobiledevice/libimobiledevice) `brew install libimobiledevice` on macOS
* Any modern desktop browser you like

### Starting the gui

This is the easiest way to start if you don't want to modify the project.

* Open the terminal and `cd` into the project directory.
* If it is the first time you cloned this project, you need to install npm dependencies and build the frontend. Run `npm install` or `yarn` for the node.js requirements on the first time. Then `npm run build` (or `yarn run build`) to build the bundle.
* Then use `npm start` or `yarn start`
* Open `http://localhost:31337` in your browser. If the port 31337 is in use, set environment variable `PORT` to use an alternative port: `PORT=12345 npm start`

### Development (optional)

For those who wants to contribute, you may probably need to restart the api server and reload webpage each time you make a change. The following steps enable livereload.

#### API server

```shell
yarn
npm run dev
```

#### Webpack server

```shell
cd gui
yarn
npm run dev
```

#### Frida script compiler

Frida agent needs to be compiled at the first time: `npm run build`

If you need livereload like webpack, use `npm run watch`.



Now open localhost:8080 in browser.
